DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY ORDER:
==========================
1. Core file processing (PDF/DOCX extraction)
2. Basic database operations (CRUD)
3. Simple regex-based data extraction
4. REST API endpoints
5. Basic React frontend
6. Enhanced LLM extraction
7. OCR capabilities
8. Advanced shortlisting
9. Authentication & security
10. Polish & optimization

FALLBACK STRATEGIES:
===================
If time constraints hit:
- Skip OCR â†’ Focus on PDF/text resumes only
- Skip advanced LLM â†’ Use regex + basic NLP
- Skip auth â†’ Simple password or no auth
- Skip advanced UI â†’ Basic forms work fine
- Skip semantic search â†’ Keyword matching only

MINIMUM VIABLE FEATURES:
=======================
Must Have (Core MVP):
âœ“ Upload PDF/DOCX resumes
âœ“ Extract basic info (name, email, phone, skills)
âœ“ Store in database
âœ“ View candidate list
âœ“ Basic keyword-based shortlisting

Nice to Have (Enhancements):
â—‹ OCR for image resumes
â—‹ LLM-powered extraction
â—‹ Advanced semantic matching
â—‹ Real-time progress indicators
â—‹ Export functionality

STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
===================================

Each step should be executed in order. After completing each step:
1. Commit changes to Git with meaningful message
2. Test the functionality implemented
3. Verify everything works before moving to next step
4. Document any issues or deviations from plan

The plan is designed so that after each step, you have a working system that builds upon the previous step. Each phase delivers a major milestone that can be demonstrated.

CONTINGENCY PLANS:
==================
- If Ollama/LLM fails: Fall back to regex-based extraction
- If OCR fails: Focus on PDF/text resume processing
- If time runs short: Skip advanced features, focus on MVP
- If database issues: Use SQLite as backup
- If frontend time limited: Create simple forms instead of advanced UI

FINAL NOTES:
============
- Prioritize MVP functionality over advanced features
- Keep detailed commit history for technical interview
- Document all assumptions and design decisions
- Be prepared to explain trade-offs made due to time constraints
- Focus on demonstrable working features over perfection

Ready to start implementation!
