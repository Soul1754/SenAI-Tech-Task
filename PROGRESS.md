- `npm run db:seed` - Seed database with sample data
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset and reseed database
- `npm run db:test` - Test database connection

## âœ… STEP 3 COMPLETE: Complete Express.js Backend Setup

### Completed Tasks:

- âœ… Created comprehensive API routing structure with 7 route modules
- âœ… Implemented authentication system with JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing
- âœ… Built authorization middleware with role-based access control (ADMIN, RECRUITER, HR_MANAGER)
- âœ… Created controllers for Authentication, User management, and Resume processing
- âœ… Added security middleware with rate limiting, CORS, and helmet protection
- âœ… Updated database schema with user fields (isActive, lastLogin)
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive error handling and request validation
- âœ… Set up complete CRUD operations structure for all entities
- âœ… Fixed Prisma client imports and database schema issues
- âœ… **TESTED AND VERIFIED**: User registration, login, protected endpoints, JWT authentication

### API Features:

- **Authentication System**: JWT-based with role-based authorization
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, helmet, bcrypt password hashing
- **API Structure**: Modular controllers with consistent response format
- **Working Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration âœ“
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication âœ“
  - `GET /api/auth/me` - Protected user profile âœ“
  - `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Profile updates âœ“
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive middleware with proper HTTP status codes

### Project Structure:

```
